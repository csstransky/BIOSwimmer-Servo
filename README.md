## The real time controlled servo

This project is about controlling the servo with 
a Raspberry Pi in real time. For every clock cycle 
(or anyother certain period of time), the raspberry 
pi will scan from a file which contains angles 
and coordinates. The raspberry pi would then do 
the calculation based on these input and control 
the servo based on the result
